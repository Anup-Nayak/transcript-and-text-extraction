Ecology & EcosystemEcology: The scientific study of interactions between organisms and
their environments, focusing on energy transfer.WHAT IS ECOLOGY?
Ecosystem has two factors:
Biotic factors : All living organisms
inhabiting the Earth.
Abiotic factors : Nonliving parts of
the environment (i.e.
temperature,
soil, light, moisture, air currents).
Components of Ecosystem
Organism
-
•
A
group
of
unicellular
or
multicellular
form
exhibiting
all
of
the
characteristics
of
life
.
•
Produce
fertile
offspring
.
•
The
lowest
level
of
organization
.
Population-
•A group of organisms of one
species living in the same place
at the same time.
•Interbreed.
•Compete with each other for
resources (food, mates, shelter,
etc.).
Community :
•Several interacting species in
a population that inhabit in a
common environment.
•They are interdependent.
Ecosystem:
•Interaction of populations in
a community (Biotic) with
abiotic factors (ex.
marine,
terrestrial)
Biosphere :
•Life supporting portions of
Earth composed of air, land,
fresh water, and salt water.
•The highest level of
organization.
Feeding Relationships
There are 3 main types of feeding
relationships
Producer - Consumer
Predator–Prey
Host-PathogenProducer : All autotrophs (Plants).
Photosynthesis
Use sun light energy to convert carbon
dioxide and water into oxygen and
Carbohydrates
6CO2+ 6H2O 6O2+ C6H12O6
Sun LightEnergy
Consumer - all heterotrophs: they
ingest food from producers.
Primary Consumer
Herbivores: Eat Plants
Secondary Consumer
Carnivores: Eat Meat
Omnivores: Eat both Plants & Animals
Decomposers: Decaying plants & animals
Tertiary
ConsumerSecondary

Interspecific competition occurs when individuals of different
species compete for same resource for their growth and
survival within an ecosystem system.
Competitive exclusion
Russian ecologist G.
F.
Gause (1934) grew two closely related species,Paramecium
AureliaandParamecium caudatumwith limited amount of food.
When grew together,P.
caudatumbecame extinct in the culture.
When two species were grown separately, each population grew rapidly.
He concluded that two species competing for the same limiting resources cannot
coexist.
Resource partitioning
American ecologist Eugene Odum observed that seven species of Anolis lizards live
in close proximity, and all feed on insects .
Competition for food is reduced because each lizard species has different perches
and preferred insect.
The differentiation of niches that enables similar species to coexist in a community
is called resource partitioning.
Ecological RelationshipsPredation
Predation is the interaction between species in
which one species kills and eats, the predator.
The other which is killed by predator- Prey.
Ananimal that eatplant’stissues: Predator .
Alionattacking and eating an antelope: Predator.
Adaptation of Predator: Many predators also have adaptations such as claws, teeth, fangs, stingers, or poison
that help them catch and subdue their food.
Eating and avoiding being eaten are prerequisite to reproductive success, thus the adaptations of both
predators and prey are refined through natural selection.
Adaption of Prey: Prey have adaptations that help them avoid being eaten.
Cryptic coloration:
Makes animal difficult to
see by predator
Canyon tree frogAposematic coloration:
Effective chemical defenses
exhibiting bright coloration.
Poison dart frogEcological RelationshipsMimicry: Some prey species are protected by their resemblance to other species.
Batesian mimicry:
A palatable or harmless species
mimics an unpalatable or
harmful one.
Müllerian mimicry:
Two or more unpalatable
species resemble each other
Producer’smimicry:
Plant leaf mimicking as
Pitcher to catch insect.Fascinating MimicryFascinating Mimicry
Ecological RelationshipsSymbiosis: When individuals of two or more species live in direct and intimate
contact with one another.
Mutualism:
Mutualistic symbiosis, or
mutualism, is an
interspecies interaction
that benefits both species
Inlichens (blue-green algae)
the algae provide food to the
fungus through photosynthesis
and the fungal partner in return
provides protection.Commensalism:
An interaction between
species that benefits one of
the species but neither
harms nor helps the other
The buffalo is getting his back
cleaned from insects as bird is
eating the insectsParasitism:
An interaction in which one organism,
the parasite, derives its nourishment
from another organism, its host.,
which affects the survival of host.
Ectoparasite:
Ticks feast on blood of
living on dogs and cats.
Endoparasite:
Ring stage of malarial
parasite in human blood
causing Malaria.Ecological succession
•
Ecological succession
is the process by which an ecosystem recovers from some abiotic
disaster
like volcanic eruption,
glaciere
, fire, earthquake.
•
There are stages, and at each stage there are distinct species
Secondary
succession
:
An
existing
community
has
been
cleared
by
some
disturbance
that
leaves
the
soil
intact
.
After
sometimes
the
area
begins
to
return
to
something
like
its
original
state
.
Yellowstone following the 1988 fires

Two
types
of
succession
:
Primary
succession
-
The
ecosystem
suffered
a
total
loss
.
Species
from
the
outside
are
recolonizing
to
begins
in
a
virtually
lifeless
area
.
Glacier Bay, AlaskaSpecies Diversity in CommunitySpecies diversity:
Variety of different kinds of organisms that
make up the community.
It has two
components.
Species richness: the number of different species in
the community.
Relative abundance: Proportion each species
represents of all individuals in the community.Example:
Two small forest communities, each with 100
individuals distributed among four tree
species (A, B, C, and D)
Community 2: 80A, 5B, 5C, 10D
A DC B
Community 1: 25A, 25B, 25C, 25D
1 is more diverse.Biomimicry
Why engineers need to study ecology?
•Scientists get the idea from the nature.
•That helps them to develop devices useful for human use.
•Stabilizing CO2emissions.
Science Copies Nature's Secrets - Biomimicry 1.1-8.2Nutrient Cycles
Cycling maintains homeostasis (balance) in
the environment.
•3 cycles to investigate:
1.
Water cycle
2.
Carbon cycle
3.
Nitrogen cycleWater cycle-
•Evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitationCarbon cycle-
•Photosynthesis and respiration cycle carbon and
oxygen through the environment.Nitrogen cycle-
Atmospheric nitrogen (N2) makes up nearly 78%-80% of air.
Organisms can not use it in that form.
Lightning and bacteria convert nitrogen into usable forms.
Nitrogen fixation -convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into
ammonium (NH4+) which can be used to make organic compounds
like amino acids.
N2 NH4+
Only in certain bacteria and industrial technologies can fix
nitrogen.Global warming: Threat to EcosystemTheozone layer is a region of Earth's stratosphere
that absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet
radiation.
It contains high concentration of ozone
(O3) in relation to other parts.
Green House Gases : Human activities release a
variety of gaseous waste products like Carbon
dioxide, Nitrous oxide etc due to the fossil fuels
burning, industrialization and deforestation.
Due to rising concentrations of long-lived greenhouse
gases, much of the solar radiation that strikes the
planet is reflected back toward Earth.
Global models predict that by the end of the 21st
century, the atmospheric CO2concentration will
more than double, increasing average global
temperature by about 3°C (5°F).Global warmingEffect of Global Warming
Relative sea level increased
Variation of Earth surface temperature
Environmental Engineering
Need many approaches to slow global warming:
•Replacing fossil fuels with renewable solar and wind
Power.
•More use of nuclear power.
•Stabilizing CO2emissions.
•Development of Biodegradable materials.
•Air pollution control & industrial hygiene improvement.
•Radiation protection, & hazardous waste management.
•Reduce deforestation around the world.1.
